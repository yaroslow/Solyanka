Using IEventContainer to handle events
===

### IEventContainer

For using events before and after handling queries and commands install [Solyanka.Dispatcher with NuGet]() to your project:
By Nuget Package Manager:
    `Install-Package Solyanka.Dispatcher`
By .Net command line interface:
    `dotnet add package Solyanka.Dispatcher`

Then [add all dependencies to your DI container]() inclde 'EventContainer' as 'IEventContainer'

Or if you are using Microsoft.DependencyInjection you may install [Solyanka.Dispatcher.Microsoft.DependencyInjection](http://here_will_be_link) to your project:
By Nuget Package Manager:
    `Install-Package Solyanka.Dispatcher.Microsoft.DependencyInjection`
By .Net command line interface:
    `dotnet add package Solyanka.Dispatcher.Microsoft.DependencyInjection`

And then inject:
```csharp
    ...
    //Other services injecting
    
    services.AddDispatcher(assembliesToWatch => assembliesToWatch.Add(typeof(GetUserQuery).Assembly));
    
    //IEventContainer will be automatically add to DI
    ...
```

### Pipeline units

To handle events in 'IEventContainer' before and after handling queries and commands install [Solyanka.Dispatcher.EventPushing with NuGet]() to your project:
By Nuget Package Manager:
    `Install-Package Solyanka.Dispatcher.EventPushing`
By .Net command line interface:
    `dotnet add package Solyanka.Dispatcher.EventPushing`

And then configure your pipelines with appropriate pipeline units:
```csharp
    ...
    //Other services injecting
    
    services
        .AddDispatcher(assembliesToWatch => assembliesToWatch.Add(typeof(GetUserQuery).Assembly))
        .ConfigureQueryPipeline(pipeline => 
        {
            //...
            pipeline.Add(typeof(EventPushingQueryUnit<,>));
            //others
        })
        .ConfigureCommandPipeline(pipeline => {
            //...
            pipeline.Add(typeof(EventPushingCommandUnit<,>))
            //others
        });
    ...
```
